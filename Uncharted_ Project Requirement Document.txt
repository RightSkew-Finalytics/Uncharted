Uncharted - A Pre Market Analysis Tool
Project Objective


The objective of this project is to develop a pre-market analysis tool for intraday cash segment traders, which will help them identify stocks with great momentum for the next trading session. The tool will use central pivot range (CPR) to identify the potential big-moving stocks and also provide insights into which sector is likely to have the greatest impact.


Problem Statement


As a new trader, it can be challenging to identify stocks with good momentum for intraday trading. This project aims to solve this problem by developing a pre-market analysis tool that can provide traders with real-time insights into the potential big movers for the next trading session.
